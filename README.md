I improvised the `AI movement` by using curves generated by sampling turning points of A* pathfinding algorithm, so i didn't had to code much of complex Collision checks, and state checks, and such.

There are also bunch of local jokes, Shader animations in the main menu if you are patient enough and basic High Score feature.

Menu music by Kolificent.
